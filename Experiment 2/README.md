# AI Economist Training Examples

[AI Economist](https://blog.einstein.ai/the-ai-economist/) is a project which aims to research the dynamics of economics by RL. The gym like environment is provided as [salesforce/ai-economist](https://github.com/salesforce/ai-economist).

This repository provides some examples to train agents. Refer more details on my [blog post](https://medium.com/vitalify-asia/ai-economist-sums-up-communism-21260e5540f8).

## Getting started

1. Install [requirements](./requirements.txt).
    * [AI Economist](https://github.com/salesforce/ai-economist)
    * [RLlib](https://github.com/ray-project/ray#rllib-quick-start)
2. Run train script.
```
cd src
python train_free_market.py
```

It trains forever. Please stop it manually.

## Results

This repository contains 4 different experiments.

* Free market
* Communism (Tax rate is 1.0 in all tax brackets.)
* Machine (The reward of agents is social productivity.)
* Dystopia (The reward of agents is social productivity times equality.)

### Free market

It uses exact same environment settings with the [basic tutorial](https://github.com/salesforce/ai-economist/blob/master/tutorials/economic_simulation_basic.ipynb) at [salesforce/ai-economist](https://github.com/salesforce/ai-economist).

```

## Communism

In this scenario, the tax rate is fixed to 100% in all tax brackets.

```

## Machine

In this scenario, the reward of agents is the social productivity. Agents do not feel happy or not.

## Dystopia

In this scenario, the reward of agents is the social productivity times equality. Agents do not feel happy or not.

## Technical notes

The hyper parameters and the methods are not exact same with the original paper. Here are the main differences.

* Used fc net, not conv net, with flatten observations.
* Not used LSTM.
    * I tried [train_lstm.py](src/train_lstm.py), but the result is almost same at least in free market.
* The value function shares weights with pi function.

Some notes.

* LayerNorm was essential in my experiments.
* Observation is not scaled. (It's not mentioned on paper.)
* Communism should have used 2 phase training and tax annealing.
